# Hydra

The Hydra Protocol and Stack

## Prerequisite github projects

- imatix/gsl
- zeromq/libzmq
- zeromq/czmq
- zeromq/zproto

## Goals

Hydra is a protocol for opportunistic state exchange. State is composed of "posts" that have zero or more "tags" which allow searching and categorization. Peers carry a number of posts that they offer to others.

While some state exchange prototocols focus on eventual consistency and replication, Hydra focuses on exploration. These are the assumptions we made when designing Hydra:

* Peers will see each other and connect for short periods of time, over fragile connections, usually WiFi.
* The value of a post diminishes rapidly with time, thus any exchange starts with the most recent posts and works backwards in time.
* We do not care, at this stage, about authentication, encryption, or identity. Posts are anonymous and provided as-is, without any specified level of trust.
* Posts consist of opaque content plus metadata.
* Posts are uniquely identified by a hash (post ID) generated by its producer.
* Posts are immutable.

## Work in Progress

This is an exercise not a formal proposal. :-)
