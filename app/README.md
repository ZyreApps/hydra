## Building the Hydra QML App

To build the app please follow these steps:

1. Build the QML bindings - use the instructions in `<top-level>/bindings/qml/README.md`
2. Build the app itself in QT Creator (`hydra_app.pro`)

## Notes

### Cross-compiling for Android

Here are some notes and gotchas for building this for Android:

* The 'Run qmake' step in QT Creator should be used to invoke the custom `build.sh` script for the hydra bindings project (if you are not using the rake file)
* The `build.sh` script that is generated by zproject:
  * depends on the physical location of the libzmq, czmq, zyre and hydra projects to be in the same folder
  * builds libsodium independently (as it is a dependency to libzmq unless otherwise configured)
  * does not do any rebuilding of the above projects unless `ANDROID_BUILD_CLEAN` is set in the environment
* QT Creator typically also does not rebuild the bindings if they are changed for some reason (this is independent of the caching of the dependencies that `build.sh` does)
