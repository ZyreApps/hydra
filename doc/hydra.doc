#### hydra - main Hydra API

The hydra class provides a public API to the Hydra peer to peer service.
This service runs as a background thread (an actor), and offers a
blocking synchronous API intended for single-threaded UI code. To use
the Hydra actor, you configure it, and then start it, and it runs until
you destroy the actor. The Hydra service logic is: discover new peer,
sync posts with peer, disconnect, and repeat forever. If multiple new
peers appear at the same time, Hydra will synch to and from them all
simultaneously.

Posts and content are held in a single directory tree, by default .hydra
under the current working directory. You can override the location when
calling hydra_new ().

This is the class interface:

Please add @interface section in ../src/hydra.c.

This is the class self test code:

    //  Simple create/destroy test
    hydra_t *self = hydra_new (NULL);
    assert (self);
    hydra_destroy (&self);
